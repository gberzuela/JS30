Challenge 1: JS Drum Kit

-   HTML:
    -   data-\* attributes: we could use this syntax to avoid having to use more classes/ids than necessary.
    -   audio attributes: different way of accessing audio files and playing sound. Very similar to using JS's Audio object.
    -   kbd attributes: diplays the innerHTML as a button or key.
-   CSS: Kind of challenging figuring out what each css expression did. Mainly learned how to use background-image.
-   JS: Great practice to help understand how we could grab keyCodes from a document and creating the habit of separating event handlers/listeners.
