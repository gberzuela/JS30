1. [JavaScript Drum Kit](https://github.com/gberzuela/JS30/tree/main/01-JS%20Drum%20Kit)
   -- HTML: Was introduced to the data-\* attribute and how we could use this syntax to avoid having to use more classes/ids than necessary.
   -- CSS: Kind of challenging figuring out what each css expression did.
   -- JS: Great practice to help understand how we could grab keyCodes from a document and creating the habit of separating event handlers/listeners.
